In order to view metrics on the dashboards, you need to create some usage. Ideally you will use Weaviate as you would normally use it in this step.

### Open Grafana in the browser
* Open your Browser at `localhost:3000`
* Log into the Grafana instance using weaviate/weaviate. 
* Select one of the sample dashboards, such as "Importing Data Into Weaviate".
